Advent calendar skill tutorial built for teaching kids to code

I would recommend this tutorial as a starting point on Alexa skills introducing how to set up accounts on AWS and Amazon developer portal:
https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit/alexa-skill-quick-start-tutorial

Setup:

*Sign up/ log in to AWS Lambda: https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda

*Select "create function"

*Give it a name and select "choose an existing role" -> "lambda_basic_execution"

*Save this and you will be taken to a code editor. Copy the ARN number at the top right corner, you will need this.

*Sign up/ log in to: https://developer.amazon.com/login.html

*Select Alexa from menu-> Get Started -> Add a New Skill

*Complete details, give it a name, etc

*When it asks for the endpoint, you can past your ARN number copied from lamba function.
